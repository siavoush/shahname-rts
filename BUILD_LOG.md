# Build Log

Chronological record of what each Claude Code session shipped. Append-only. The design chat reads this to understand what state the project is in without having to re-read code.

## Format for new entries

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — session title (e.g., "Tier 0 kickoff", "Kaveh Event prototype")

**Branch:** feat/whatever (or main if merged)
**Shipped:** what works at the end of this session, in plain English.
**Did not ship:** what was attempted but isn't done.
**State for next session:** what the next session needs to know to pick up — running the project, where to look, any setup steps, any half-finished work to be aware of.
**Open questions added to QUESTIONS_FOR_DESIGN.md:** list them by title.
**Decisions made independently** (per CLAUDE.md "Escalation" rule #1 — non-design implementation choices): list briefly so the design chat isn't surprised later.
```
